## Computing with R

### Instruction

Compute the following equation:

<center><font size="8"> $\sqrt{\frac{2^{3+1}}{\frac{4}{5\times{6}}}-20}$ </font></center>

### Solution

The idea is to do things step by step and always check that things are OK before they get too complex:

```{r equation}
3+1
(3+1)
2^(3+1)
(2^(3+1)) / 4
(2^(3+1)) / (4 / (5*6))
((2^(3+1)) / (4 / (5*6))) - 20
sqrt(((2^(3+1)) / (4 / (5*6))) - 20)
```


## Data exploration

### Instruction

Using the dataset `TitanicSurvival`, figure out: 

- how many rows and columns are they in this dataset?
- how many columns correspond to factors?
- how many females below 20 years old survived in 2nd class, and how many did not?

### Solution

There are `r nrow(TitanicSurvival)` rows and `r ncol(TitanicSurvival)` columns:
```{r}
dim(TitanicSurvival)
```

There are 3 factors:

```{r}
str(TitanicSurvival)
```

To compute how many females below 20 years old survived in 2nd class and how many did not, you can do:

```{r}
test <- TitanicSurvival[TitanicSurvival$sex == "female" &
                         TitanicSurvival$age < 20 &
                         TitanicSurvival$passengerClass == "2nd", ]
table(test$survived)
```
Many other ways are possible, such as:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
TitanicSurvival |>
  filter(sex == "female", age < 20, passengerClass == "2nd") |>
  count(survived)
```



## An example of programming

### Instruction

The following function can be used to investigate the statistical power of a t-test (i.e. the probability to detect a significant effect when they really is one = rate of true positive):

```{r example, fig.show='hide'}
compare_heights <- function(n_group = 10, height_difference = 5) {
  male   <- rnorm(n = n_group, mean = 180, sd = 6)
  female <- rnorm(n = n_group, mean = 180 - height_difference, sd = 6)
  t_test_res <- t.test(male, female)
  t_test_res$p.value
}

N <- seq(from = 10, to = 60, by = 2)
power <- sapply(N, function(n) mean(replicate(100, compare_heights(n_group = n)) <= 0.05))
plot(power ~ N)
```

Can you run, read and understand this code?

### Solution

I cannot really correct that one here. Ask me if you don't get it.
