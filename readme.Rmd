# LM2GLMM

This is the repository for the R package LM2GLMM.
This R package is only aimed at the students and helpers of the course I am giving at the 
Freie Universit√§t, Berlin. It is not aimed at general users.

1. install the R package ```drat``` (only if you don't have it):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("drat")
```

2. install the R package LM2GLMM:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
drat::addRepo("courtiol")
install.packages("LM2GLMM")
```
