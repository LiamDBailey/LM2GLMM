#' Sample from the Ten-Year Follow-up (1980) of the 1970 British Cohort Study
#'
#' This dataset is a sample of few variables taken fron the Ten-Year Follow-up
#' (1980) of the 1970 British Cohort Study (BSC70).
#'
#' The BCS70 began in 1970 when data were collected about the 17,198 babies born
#' in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the week 5-11 April.
#'
#' At this time, the study was named the British Births Survey (BBS) and it was
#' sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund, in association with the Royal
#' College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
#'
#' Since 1970, there have been four attempts to gather information from the full
#' cohort - when they were aged 5, 10, 16 and 26 years. 90% of the 1970 Cohort
#' were traced and completed one or more survey documents.
#'
#' In 1975 and 1980, the cohort was augmented by the inclusion of immigrants to
#' Britain who were born in the target week in 1970. Subjects from Northern
#' Ireland who had been included in the birth survey, were dropped from the
#' study in all subsequent sweeps.
#'
#' The BCS70 Ten-year Follow-up is the second full national follow-up of the
#' 1970 cohort born in Great Britain 5-11 April 1970. The cohort has been
#' surveyed comprehensively at birth, five, ten, 16 and 26 years, and samples
#' were seen at 22 months, 42 months, seven and 21 years. The BCS70 Ten-year
#' Follow-up was originally titled the Child Health and Education Study (CHES),
#' but in 1991 the whole 1970 Cohort Study was renamed the British Cohort Study
#' 1970 (BCS70) and the ten-year sweep became known as BCS70 Ten-year Follow-up.
