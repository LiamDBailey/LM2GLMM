# What remains to be done?

## To do for LM

* r-squares
* extrapolation
* (multi)collinearity
* model building (how many data you need... bla bla)



# Code for later?

## Terrible residuals

```{r terrible}
mod <- lm(log(weight) ~ sex*(weight + drink + height), data = UK) ## notice weight used twice...
```
