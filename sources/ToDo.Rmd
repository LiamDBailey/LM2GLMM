# What remains to be done?

## To do for LM

* r-squares, which I am not sure where to squeeze in
* (multi)collinearity, which I could add to the test bit
* backward stepAIC demo
* model building (how many data you need... bla bla), which I could also add to the test bits, or I could create something new with multicollinearity within model building
* a discussion about extrapolation when predicting which I also don't know where to squeeze in


# Code for later?

## Terrible residuals

```{r terrible}
mod <- lm(log(weight) ~ sex*(weight + drink + height), data = UK) ## notice weight used twice...
```
