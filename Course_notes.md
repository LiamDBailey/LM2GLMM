# Course notes

## Year 2020 (COVID19)

### Session introduction

It took 3 hours including the planned exercises and some improvised with 20 online students.

### Session LM_introduction

It took 2 hours without the exercises. Predictions should perhaps be introduced first less formally to ease the transition into the world of design matrices.

## Session LM_fit

It tooks ~ 3 hours (I think, cannot remember for sure). We did exercise the remaining time (~ 2 hours).

## Session LM_test_intervals

It took 5 hours to get to just before CI for mean responses. No exercises.
